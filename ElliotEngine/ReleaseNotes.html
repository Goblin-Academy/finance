<BODY>

<P>
<B>EWaveTrade</B> is a tool to aid in the process of analyzing market price data using the Elliot Wave Theory, 
particularly applying the concepts and principles developed by Glenn Neely.
<BR>
The book "Mastering Elliott Wave" by Glen Neely is recommended for both potential developers and users of this software. 

<P>
<B>EWaveTrade</B> Runs on Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP, although the core Elliot Engine sources are designed to be operating system independent.

<P>
<B>EWaveTrade</B> is a free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.
<BR>The sources are written C++, using Microsoft Foundation Classes. Compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (or higher).

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> In order to use the visualization support, you need to download a 3rd party package called ChartDirector.
(ChartDirector is not Open Source.)
<BR>There is a "trial version" that can be downloaded from Advanced Software 
Engineering Limited and used for free for non-commercial purposes.
<BR>See <a href="http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html">http://www.advsofteng.com/download.html</a>.
<BR>This package needs to be installed as shown in this picture:
<BR>("Copy of ElliotEngine" is where you have unzipped this project, i.e. where the sources are located.)
<P>

<P>
(The developers of the <B>EWaveTrade</B> project at SourceForge are not affiliated with Advanced Software Engineering in any way.
<BR>That package is just used as a resource for visualizing data from <B>EWaveTrade</B>.)

<P>
Note also the the project sources contain two Visual C++ build projects; one with and one without ChartDirector.
<BR>If you can't (or won't) download the ChartDirector package, you can still build the vanilla variant.
<BR>This will parse an input file containing historical price data for a stock or an index, 
<BR>and produce an output file with the identified monowaves and their Retracement Rule and Condition labels.

<P>
